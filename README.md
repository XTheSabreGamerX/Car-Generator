# Car-Generator

Getting into the world of enums is a tough world for me, considering I suck at using arrays. In this program, it utilizes objects created in the main class(CarDemo) that has three values, an int for the year of the car, a model, and the color of the car. Values are found in both the Model and Color enums in each respective classes. This was a real pain in the ass, then again, tackling new concepts in programming each time always is going to be tricky. I had fun doing this though! Gave me a cool impression of enums.
